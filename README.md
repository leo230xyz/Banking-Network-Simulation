üè¶ Secure Enterprise Banking Network SimulationThis project is a detailed simulation of a multi-branch enterprise banking network, built and configured using Cisco Packet Tracer. It demonstrates expertise in modern network design, including VLAN segmentation, dynamic routing protocols (EIGRP), secure remote access (SSH), centralized services, and robust security policies (Access Control Lists).üöÄ Key Features and Implemented ServicesThis simulation integrates critical networking functions and services to represent a functional enterprise environment:1. Network Segmentation & RoutingVLAN Implementation: The network is logically segmented into multiple VLANs (e.g., Employees, Servers, Management, Branch) to improve performance, security, and broadcast domain management.Inter-VLAN Routing: Achieved using a Router-on-a-Stick configuration on the core router, enabling seamless communication between different VLANs.EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol): Used as the primary routing protocol within the bank's internal network to ensure dynamic and efficient path discovery and fault tolerance.Default Routing: A static default route is configured on the edge router to direct all traffic destined for unknown external networks (the internet/WAN) to the correct gateway.2. Security and Access Control (ACL)The project includes a critical Extended Access Control List (ACL) implementation on the edge router (HQ-Router) to enforce a security boundary:Source NetworkDestination AccessRationaleInternal Bank Networks (Trusted)Full Access (Any/Any)Employees require unrestricted access to all internal and external services.External/Unknown Networks (Untrusted)Restricted Access (DNS & Web only)Limits external exposure; prevents unauthorized access to sensitive services like FTP, SSH, or Syslog.SSH Configuration: Devices are configured for SSH access (in preference to Telnet) for secure, encrypted remote management by IT staff.Console Line Security: Console access is secured with robust passwords to prevent unauthorized physical access to network devices.3. Infrastructure and Application ServicesDHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol): Configured to automatically assign IP addresses, subnet masks, and default gateway information to end devices within specific VLANs.DNS Server: Maps domain names (e.g., bank.com, mail.bank.com) to their corresponding IP addresses.Web Server (HTTP/HTTPS): Hosts the bank's external-facing website, accessible to the public (as governed by the ACL).FTP Server (File Transfer Protocol): Configured for internal employee use to manage and share files securely within the network.Email Server (SMTP/POP3): Allows employees to send and receive internal communications (user@bank.com).Syslog Server: Centralizes logging and monitoring of network device events and errors, crucial for operational troubleshooting and security auditing.üó∫Ô∏è Network TopologyThe network design follows a standard hierarchical model, connecting a central Headquarters (HQ) to a Branch Office over a simulated WAN link.The topology is divided into functional areas:Headquarters (HQ): Houses the core router, multi-layer switch, and all centralized servers (DNS, Web, Mail, FTP, Syslog).Branch: Includes its own switch infrastructure and user devices, connected via the EIGRP routing domain.WAN / External: The connection to the "internet" through a separate router to test the Default Route and the ACL security policy.üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Protocols UsedCategoryProtocol / ToolPurposeSimulationCisco Packet TracerNetwork design, configuration, and testing.RoutingEIGRP, Static RoutingDynamic internal routing and external gateway configuration.SecurityAccess Control Lists (ACL), SSH, Console Line SecurityFiltering traffic, restricting access, and secure device management.AddressingDHCP, VLAN Tagging (802.1Q)Dynamic IP distribution and logical network separation.ApplicationHTTP, DNS, SMTP, POP3, FTPProviding web services, name resolution, email, and file sharing.‚öôÔ∏è How to Test and Run the ProjectPrerequisites: You must have the latest version of Cisco Packet Tracer installed.Open File: Load the project file (.pkt file - assuming you will name/upload it).Verification Steps:Internal Connectivity: Test connectivity (Ping) between devices in different VLANs (e.g., an HQ PC to a Branch PC) to confirm EIGRP and Inter-VLAN routing work.ACL Test (Success): An HQ PC should be able to browse the Web Server, send an email, and access the FTP server.ACL Test (Failure): An external network PC (OUTSIDE-Router) should only be able to browse the Web Server and query the DNS server. Attempts to access the FTP, Email, or SSH ports should be blocked by the ACL.DHCP Test: Verify that end devices successfully obtain their IP address automatically from the DHCP server pool.Email Test: Send and receive an email between two employee PCs (e.g., PC1@bank.com to PC2@bank.com).Feel free to download the file and explore the router and switch configurations to review the ACL and EIGRP settings!
